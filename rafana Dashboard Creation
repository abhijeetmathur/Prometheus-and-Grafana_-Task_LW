Creating a Grafana dashboard to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus involves installing Grafana, connecting it to Prometheus as a data source, and then creating a dashboard to display metrics like CPU usage and memory usage. Here's how to do it step-by-step:

Step 1: Install Grafana
Download and Install Grafana:

For Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/release/deb stable main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana
For CentOS/RHEL:

sudo yum install -y https://packages.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-<version>.rpm
Replace <version> with the latest version number.

For Windows: Download the Windows installer from the Grafana download page.
Start Grafana:

sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
Access Grafana:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. The default login credentials are:

Username: admin
Password: admin (you will be prompted to change it after the first login)
Step 2: Configure Prometheus as a Data Source
Add Data Source:

Click on the Gear icon (⚙️) on the left sidebar to go to Configuration.
Select Data Sources.
Click on Add data source and choose Prometheus.
Configure the Prometheus Data Source:

In the HTTP URL field, enter http://localhost:9090 (or wherever your Prometheus server is running).
Click on Save & Test to verify the connection.

Step 3: Create a Dashboard
Create a New Dashboard:

Click on the + icon on the left sidebar and select Dashboard.
Add Panels:

Click on Add new panel.

In the Query section, select Prometheus as the data source.

Enter a query to visualize CPU usage, for example:


rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])
(Adjust this query based on your available metrics.)

To visualize memory usage, you can use a query like:

node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100
Customize Your Panel:

Choose the visualization type (e.g., Graph, Gauge, Table).
Set the title of your panel.
Adjust any other settings as needed (e.g., axes, legend).
Save the Dashboard:

Click on Save Dashboard in the top right corner, provide a name for your dashboard, and save it.
